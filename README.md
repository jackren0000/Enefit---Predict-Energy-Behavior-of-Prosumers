# [Enefit - Predict Energy Behavior of Prosumers](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/predict-energy-behavior-of-prosumers)
## Kaggle Competition Overview

Enefit's challenge is to predict prosumer energy patterns to minimize imbalance costs. For details, visit [Kaggle competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/predict-energy-behavior-of-prosumers).

The goal is to align expected energy usage with actual consumption to reduce costs associated with energy imbalances.

## Competition Description

Prosumers play a pivotal role in energy imbalances, increasing operational costs and potentially destabilizing the power grid. Effective solutions could significantly reduce these costs and boost the use of renewable energy sources.

## Evaluation

Submissions are evaluated on the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) between the predicted return and the observed targe.


## Submitting

You must submit to this competition using the provided python time-series API, which ensures that models do not peek forward in time. To use the API, follow [the template in this notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sohier/enefit-basic-submission-demo).
