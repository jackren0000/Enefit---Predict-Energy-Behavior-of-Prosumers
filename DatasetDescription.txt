This competition requires forecasting the electricity generation and consumption 
of Estonian prosumers with solar panels, utilizing weather, energy price data, and 
records of photovoltaic capacity.

It's a time series forecasting contest judged by a private leaderboard based 
on real data collected post-submission. All datasets adhere to the 
EET/EEST (Eastern European Time/ Eastern European Summer Time) time standard.
Most of the variables are a sum or an average over a period of 1 hour. 
The datetime column always gives the start of the 1-hour period. 
However, for the weather datasets, some variables such as temperature or cloud cover, 
are given for a specific time, which is always the end of the 1-hour period.
