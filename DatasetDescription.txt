This competition requires forecasting the electricity generation and consumption 
of Estonian prosumers with solar panels, utilizing weather, energy price data, and 
records of photovoltaic capacity.

It's a time series forecasting contest judged by a private leaderboard based 
on real data collected post-submission. All datasets adhere to the 
EET/EEST (Eastern European Time/ Eastern European Summer Time) time standard.
Most of the variables are a sum or an average over a period of 1 hour. 
The datetime column always gives the start of the 1-hour period. 
However, for the weather datasets, some variables such as temperature or cloud cover, 
are given for a specific time, which is always the end of the 1-hour period.

Files:
tain.csv:

county - An ID code for the county.
is_business - Boolean for whether or not the prosumer is a business.
product_type - ID code with the following mapping of codes to contract types: {0: "Combined", 1: "Fixed", 2: "General service", 3: "Spot"}.
target - The consumption or production amount for the relevant segment for the hour. The segments are defined by the county, is_business, and product_type.
is_consumption - Boolean for whether or not this row's target is consumption or production.
datetime - The Estonian time in EET (UTC+2) / EEST (UTC+3). It describes the start of the 1-hour period on which target is given.
data_block_id - All rows sharing the same data_block_id will be available at the same forecast time. This is a function of what information is available when forecasts are actually made, at 11 AM each morning. For example, if the forecast weather data_block_id for predictins made on October 31st is 100 then the historic weather data_block_id for October 31st will be 101 as the historic weather data is only actually available the next day.
row_id - A unique identifier for the row.
prediction_unit_id - A unique identifier for the county, is_business, and product_type combination. New prediction units can appear or disappear in the test set.

gas_prices.csv:

origin_date - The date when the day-ahead prices became available.
forecast_date - The date when the forecast prices should be relevant.
[lowest/highest]_price_per_mwh - The lowest/highest price of natural gas that on the day ahead market that trading day, in Euros per megawatt hour equivalent.
